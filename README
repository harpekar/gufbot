A simple bot for a small discord server. It keeps track of a score for each user in a JSON object, and each user can iterate their own score up. 

Based off of the Discord Node.js Bot API, and as such requires a .env file with the bot's Key and correct installation of the dotenv and discord.js dependencies.
